  ## Description
   This single-page app is my personal portfolio page that is built with React framework.

   Landing on the page, user is presented with an 'About Me' section, which contains my photo and a short description about myself. A navbar that takes user to various sections of the page. The footer of the page is where user can find my contact details, namely LinkedIn, Github and Email. 

   With the navigation of the navbar, user can find some of my mini projects under 'Portfolio'. This section is featured with 6 screenshots of the projects. With mouse hovering on each picture, user will see the name of the project, and links to the corresponding deployed site as well as Github repository.

   Contact, being positioned next to Portfolio, is where user can leave a name, email address and message to me. Error message is triggered if any input area is missing, or email address format is invalid.

   This app is mobile friendly.
