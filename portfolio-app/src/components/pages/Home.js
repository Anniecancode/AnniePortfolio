            <p>Annie is an accountant who is interested in coding!</p>
            <p>I participated in a bootcamp organised by The University of Adelaide,  where I learnt HTML, CSS and Javascript from scratch.
               In the bootcamp, I completed a number of mini projects, where showcases my skillset, and it also gives me the confidence to feel ready for any front-end rolls.
               My mini projects can be found in "Annie's Works" section below,  please feel free to check on them.
            </p>
